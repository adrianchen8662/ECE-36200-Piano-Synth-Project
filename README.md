# ECE-36200-Piano-Synth-Project

We built a synthesizer and mixer. There were 24 buttons that played notes from C4 to B5, and could play multiple notes at once. There was also a recording functionality that allowed you to input information on an ADSR envelope, and replay at will. <br>

The components we used:
 - 1 STM32F091RCT6 microcontroller
 - 24 tactile switches
 - 1 SOC1602A OLED LCD Display 
 - 1 LM324 Quad Op-Amp
 - 1 10k Ohm resistor
 - 1 TRRS adapter
 - 1 10uF capacitor
 - 1 4x4 keypad matrix
